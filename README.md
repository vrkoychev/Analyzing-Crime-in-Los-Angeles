Data Exploratory Analysis (DEA) - DataCamp Project
This repository contains my work on the DataCamp project focused on Data Exploratory Analysis (DEA). In this project, I demonstrate essential skills for data exploration and visualization, which are critical steps in the data analysis pipeline.

Key Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Implementing various techniques to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within the data.
Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas to create meaningful visualizations that help identify trends and insights.

Techniques Covered:
Visualization with Matplotlib
Grouping and aggregating data

Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to practice and showcase the foundational techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which can be applied to any dataset to uncover hidden patterns and insights. The project helps in building a strong foundation for more advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks.

Dataset Used:
The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from Los Angeles Open Data
